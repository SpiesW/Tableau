## Project 3: Bar plot of Video Game Genres with Average Ratings
**Big Idea**: Video game genres with high average game ratings indicate strong competition; creating a new Ubisoft game in a genre with a lower average rating can give the game an immediate edge over the competition and increase the likelihood of financial success.</br>

### Data 
all_video_games(cleaned).csv - Contains genre and user review data on over 14000 video games</br>

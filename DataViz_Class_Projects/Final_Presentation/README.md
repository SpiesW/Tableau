## Final Presentation: Data Story on the Health Affects of Social Media Screentime

The final presentation for this course required individual learning of a data visualization topic to be taught to the rest of the class during the presentation. My topic was creating data stories in tableau. 
To illustrate this topic, I created a data story on the health affects of social media screentime, as shown in CompletedDataStory.twbx. 
Note that IncompleteDataStory.twbx was a file I used during the final presentation. I first presented the completed data story and then used the incomplete data story to build the complete data story so that the 
other students could follow along in the process of creating a data story.</br>

A data story allows you to prepare multiple visualizations and take your audience through the data one step at a time, coming to an overall conclusion.</br>

### Data 
sleep.csv - A sample dataset of 374 adults with a set of their health and sleep statistics

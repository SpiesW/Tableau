## Project 1: Scatter plot of Sleep Duration vs Stress Levels
**Big Idea**: Many students may not realize the negatives that come with insufficient sleep, such as added stress, so we recommend a media and Schiffert campaign to promote healthy sleep habits to improve student health.
(Schiffert is Virginia Tech's student health center)</br>

### Data
Dataset_Dviz1.csv - The dataset used for this project consists of a sample of 374 adults with a set of their health and sleep statistics.

**Note**: I misplaced the .twbx file for this project, so only an image of the project can be viewed in the images folder.

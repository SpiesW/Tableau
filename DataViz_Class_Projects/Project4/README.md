## Project 4: Animated Plot of Unemployment Rates by Party and President
**Big Idea**: When compared with the steady decrease of unemployment rates under Democratic presidents, rates under Republican presidents are unstable; choosing future candidates with goals to combat unemployment will improve these statistics, aiding the Republican partyâ€™s image and the welfare of the American people.</br>

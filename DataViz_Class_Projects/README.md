## STAT 3204: Data Visualization 

I took this course during my senior year at Virginia Tech to get a stronger background in data visualization.
The course introduced me to Tableau and gave me foundational knowledge on the core principles of visualizing data to illustrate insights from the data and tell a cohesive story.

Included in this folder are projects that I completed for assignments during the course. Each project folder has the necessary files for the visualization, 
as well as data and "big idea" files, and a link to the online version of the visualization on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.spies3886/vizzes). </br>

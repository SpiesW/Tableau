## Project 5: Dashboard of Sleep and Health Factors
**Big Idea**: With clear correlations between health factors and getting adequate sleep, it is important to encourage employees to maintain healthy sleep schedules; with some companies shifting to 4-day work weeks and maintaining their output, decreasing work time by an hour a day is not a farfetched idea, but one that could benefit employee health and morale.</br>

### Data
